# Windows Format Archives

This repository contains Windows format (.zip) archives of popular MWA Software repositories. The
reason for this is that Github generated "on the fly" release zips have text files formatted
with LF line endings. The archives in the respository contain the same files but with
text files formatted to use CR/LF line endings.

All files in this archive are formatted <repo>-<release tag>.zip
